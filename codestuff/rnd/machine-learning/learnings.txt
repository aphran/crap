Machine learning classifications:
  - Supervised learning
    We give the machine a dataset with "right answers". Its job is producing more of these right answers based on clever ways to analize data sets, using certain criteria
    - Regression problem: treat the result as a continuous value range (each data point maps to a value in the continuous range)
    - Classification problem: treat the result as a discrete value set (map data points to categories)

  - Unsupervised learning
    We give the machine data sets, without any answers or labels, and expect the machine to find a pattern or structure in the data.
    - Clustering problem: find lumps of data that seems to share a pattern or feature
    - Cocktail Party problem: use different sources of parallel data and differentiate it
    - Associative: associate characteristics in common with outcomes or end states

Process

Training set -> Learning Algo -> hypothesis function h() -> map X to Y in training set

One type of the hypothesis function is Linear Regression with one Variable : Univariate Linear Regression

A standard linear function:

 hø(x) = ø0 + ø1x
